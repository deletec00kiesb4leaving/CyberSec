# Activity Overview

In this activity, you will create an incident report using the knowledge you’ve gained about networks throughout this course to analyze a network incident. You will analyze the situation using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF). The CSF is a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. Creating a quality cybersecurity incident report and applying the CSF can demonstrate a proactive approach to security, improving communication and transparency with stakeholders, and improve security practices within your organization. You can also add the incident report you create to your cybersecurity portfolio when you complete it.

The CSF is scalable and can be applied in a wide variety of contexts. As you continue to learn more and refine your understanding of key cybersecurity skills, you can use the templates provided in this activity in other situations. Knowing how to identify which security measures to apply in response to business needs will help you determine which are the best available options when it comes to network security.

**Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. In the next course item, you will be able to self-assess your response. After that, there will be a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. It will also provide an opportunity for you to answer rubric questions that allow you to reflect on key elements of your professional statement.**

## Scenario

You are a cybersecurity analyst working for a multimedia company that offers web design services, graphic design, and social media marketing solutions to small businesses. Your organization recently experienced a DDoS attack, which compromised the internal network for two hours until it was resolved.

During the attack, your organization’s network services suddenly stopped responding due to an incoming flood of ICMP packets. Normal internal network traffic could not access any network resources. The incident management team responded by blocking incoming ICMP packets, stopping all non-critical network services offline, and restoring critical network services. 

The company’s cybersecurity team then investigated the security event. They found that a malicious actor had sent a flood of ICMP pings into the company’s network through an unconfigured firewall. This vulnerability allowed the malicious attacker to overwhelm the company’s network through a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. 

To address this security event, the network security team implemented: 

- A new firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets
- Source IP address verification on the firewall to check for spoofed IP addresses on incoming ICMP packets
- Network monitoring software to detect abnormal traffic patterns
- An IDS/IPS system to filter out some ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics

As a cybersecurity analyst, you are tasked with using this security event to create a plan to improve your company’s network security, following the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). You will use the CSF to help you navigate through the different steps of analyzing this cybersecurity event and integrate your analysis into a general security strategy.

#### **Step 2: Summarize the Security Event**

- Using the template provided, provide a summary of the security event that occurred. Include details such as:
  - **Event Description**: What happened?
  - **Cause**: How did it happen?
  - **Impact**: What was affected?
  - **Response**: How was it handled?
  - **Targeted Systems**: Which systems were involved?
  - **Attack Source**: Where did the attack originate?
  - **Estimated Impact**: Financial, reputational, or operational impact.

#### **Step 3: Identify the Type of Attack and the Systems Affected**

- Reflect on the incident and categorize the type of attack. Document:
  - **Attack Type**: e.g., DDoS, phishing, malware.
  - **Affected Systems**: Which network segments or devices were impacted.

#### **Step 4: Protect the Assets in Your Organization from Being Compromised**

- Create an action plan to prevent future incidents:
  - **Immediate Actions**: What can be done right now?
  - **Long-term Security Enhancements**: What policies and tools should be implemented or updated?

#### **Step 5: Detect Similar Incidents in the Future**

- Establish monitoring and detection strategies:
  - **Network Traffic Analysis**: Tools and methods for monitoring.
  - **User Activity Logs**: Tracking and auditing user actions.
  - **Anomaly Detection**: Systems to identify unusual activity.

#### **Step 6: Respond to Future Cybersecurity Incidents**

- Develop a response strategy for potential future incidents:
  - **Containment Procedures**: How to isolate affected systems.
  - **Neutralization Tactics**: Steps to mitigate the incident.
  - **Data Analysis**: Collecting and analyzing data for insights.
  - **Recovery Process Improvement**: Enhancements for quicker recovery.

#### **Step 7: Recover from the Incident**

- Outline the recovery steps:
  - **Data Recovery**: What data needs immediate recovery?
  - **System Restoration**: Steps to restore affected systems.
  - **Process Review**: Revisit and strengthen recovery processes.

### Template for Incident Report Using NIST CSF:

**Incident Summary:**
- Describe the DDoS attack, its impact, and initial response.

**Identify:**
- Discuss the vulnerabilities found, like the unconfigured firewall.

**Protect:**
- Detail new security measures implemented, like firewall rules and IP verification.

**Detect:**
- Explain how new monitoring software and IDS/IPS systems will help in future detection.

**Respond:**
- Outline the response strategy during the event and proposed enhancements.

**Recover:**
- Describe steps taken to recover from this incident and plans for future recoveries.

**Lessons Learned and Future Recommendations:**
- Reflect on the event, what was learned, and how security can be further strengthened.

This structured approach helps in systematically addressing the cybersecurity incident, enhancing network security, and preparing for future threats.

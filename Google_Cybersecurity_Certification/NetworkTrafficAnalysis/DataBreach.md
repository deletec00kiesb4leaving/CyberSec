# Activity Overview

In this activity, you will be presented with a scenario about a social media organization that recently experienced a major data breach caused by undetected vulnerabilities. To address the breach, you will identify some common network hardening tools that can be implemented to protect the organization’s overall security. Then, you will select a specific vulnerability that the company has and propose different network hardening methods. Finally, you will explain how the methods and tools you chose will be effective for managing the vulnerability and how they will prevent potential breaches in the future. 

In the course, you learned network hardening and network security-related hardening practices, such as port filtering, network access privileges, and encryption over networks. Network hardening practices help organizations monitor potential threats and attacks on their network and prevent some attacks from occurring. Some hardening practices are implemented every day, while others are executed every once in a while, such as every other week or once a month. Understanding how to use network hardening tools and methods will help you better monitor network activity and protect your organization’s network against various attacks.

**Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.**

## Scenario

You are a security analyst working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which compromised the safety of their customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. Your organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future. 

After inspecting the organization’s network, you discover four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows:

- The organization’s employees share passwords.
- The admin password for the database is set to the default.
- The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.
- Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used.

If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future. 

### In this activity, you will:

1. **Write a security risk assessment** to analyze the incident and explain what methods can be used to further secure the network. Here are some steps to consider:

   - **Identify Network Hardening Tools:**
     - **Password Management Systems:** To prevent password sharing and ensure each user has a unique, strong password.
     - **Firewall Configuration Tools:** To set up proper rules for traffic filtering.
     - **MFA Solutions:** To add an additional layer of security for access control.

   - **Select a Specific Vulnerability:**
     - For example, choose "The admin password for the database is set to the default."

   - **Propose Network Hardening Methods:**
     - **Password Policy Enforcement:** Implement a policy where all default passwords must be changed immediately upon setup.
     - **Regular Password Audits:** Use software to check for default or weak passwords regularly.
     - **Database Access Control:** Limit who can change administrative passwords and ensure these changes are logged.

   - **Explain Effectiveness:**
     - Discuss how enforcing strong password policies reduces the risk of unauthorized access through simple password guessing or brute force attacks.
     - Describe how regular audits can catch and rectify password vulnerabilities before they are exploited.
     - Explain how controlled access to database admin functions helps in maintaining security integrity.

By implementing these methods, the organization can significantly decrease the risk of future breaches by addressing vulnerabilities at their core, promoting a culture of security, and ensuring ongoing vigilance in security practices.
